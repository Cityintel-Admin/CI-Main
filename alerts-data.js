  summary: "Thousands of Tunisians are again expected to rally in central Tunis against President Kais Saied’s tightening grip on power and his expanding crackdown on opposition parties, critics and civil society groups. Demonstrators have framed the march as a stand against one-man rule and the jailing of political opponents, journalists and activists.\n\nThe protests build on two previous weekends of mobilisation and come amid mounting complaints from rights groups that Saied is using the judiciary and security forces to silence dissent. Marchers are likely to converge along Habib Bourguiba Avenue and adjacent downtown arteries, with opposition coalitions, youth activists and NGO networks all calling for turnout. Chants denouncing authoritarianism and demanding the release of political prisoners have become a fixture of recent rallies, along with banners criticising economic hardship and rising prices.\n\nSecurity forces have so far contained the demonstrations with cordons and road closures rather than mass detentions, but police units and plain-clothes officers are routinely deployed in strength around key intersections and government buildings. Any attempt by protesters to push closer to the interior ministry or presidential sites could trigger the use of tear gas and more forceful dispersal tactics. Given the repeated nature of the rallies, the likelihood of crowd fatigue exists, yet the depth of political frustration means further weekend protests remain probable through December. Overall risk is assessed as high because of the sensitive political target, the concentration of people in a confined urban core, and the potential for a rapid shift from static chanting to confrontations if police lines tighten or arrests occur."

Demonstrators have blocked roads, thrown stones and set up makeshift barricades, while police have responded with tear gas and baton charges.\n\nThe government is facing wider fiscal pressure and has struggled to pay scholarships and allowances on time, turning the dispute into a flashpoint over living costs and youth unemployment. Although gatherings are centred on the university, spillover into adjacent neighbourhoods is possible if confrontations intensify. Most incidents so far have been short, sharp bursts of unrest rather than sustained urban rioting, which keeps the overall risk at medium; however, further escalation is possible if injuries mount or authorities move to close faculties or arrest student leaders."

  source: "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-president-says-coup-bid-thwarted-vows-retribution-2025-12-07/",
  summary: "In the early hours of 7 December, elements of Benin’s National Guard launched a coup attempt in Cotonou, attacking President Patrice Talon’s residence and seizing the state broadcaster. A small group of soldiers appeared on television to announce that they had removed the president, dissolved state institutions and created a military committee to take power. Loyalist forces quickly responded, backed by Nigerian air support and a standby ECOWAS deployment, and by late afternoon the government declared the coup foiled and said it had re-established control of key sites.\n\nThe mutineers cited grievances over deteriorating security in northern Benin, alleged favouritism within the armed forces, cuts to healthcare and insufficient support for families of soldiers killed in action. Their message resonated with some public frustrations, but there was no broad civilian uprising in support of the takeover; most residents sheltered indoors as heavy gunfire and explosions echoed around central Cotonou and districts near the presidential compound. Authorities imposed tight security perimeters around ministries, the airport and key intersections, while checkpoints and patrols were reinforced on arterial roads linking the capital to Porto-Novo and the interior.\n\nIn the operation to regain control of the national TV station and other seized locations there were casualties on both sides, and several journalists were temporarily held hostage before being released. Multiple officers were arrested, although the alleged ringleader, Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri, initially remained at large. Regional capitals and international partners, including ECOWAS and the African Union, quickly condemned the coup attempt and voiced support for constitutional order.\n\nFor operational planning, Cotonou should be treated as a high-risk environment in the short term. While the immediate mutiny has been suppressed, the government has promised vigorous investigations and retribution, raising the possibility of further sporadic arrests and military tensions. Security forces are likely to maintain a visible presence across the city and remain quick to break up any gatherings perceived as sympathetic to the putschists. Normal commercial activity is expected to resume gradually, but sudden roadblocks, identity checks and temporary closures of public buildings are likely as authorities consolidate control and search for remaining suspects."

Roadblocks, checkpoints and patrols have been stepped up on highways, particularly routes carrying traffic from Nigeria, as authorities search for remaining mutineers and possible accomplices.\n\nAuthorities have acknowledged casualties among both loyalist troops and coup supporters and have vowed to track down anyone linked to the plot. Although there are no large-scale civilian demonstrations, the heightened military posture and uncertainty around further arrests increase the risk of incidental disruption for travellers and local businesses. The risk level is assessed as medium: the main threat comes from sudden cordons, vehicle searches and short-notice movement restrictions rather than organised protest marches."

  summary: "Opposition groups and activists in Tanzania have called for nationwide demonstrations on 9 December, Independence Day, to denounce alleged election irregularities and security-force abuses. In response, police have publicly declared that any protest will be illegal on the grounds that organisers have not filed formal notifications, and they have warned that participants risk arrest.\n\nAhead of the date, authorities have urged citizens to stay at home and treat the day as a period of rest and celebration, while at the same time deploying large numbers of police and military personnel along major roads in Dar es Salaam and the northern city of Arusha. International observers, including the UN human rights office, have expressed concern about earlier lethal force used during post-election unrest and are urging restraint on all sides. The risk for 9 December is assessed as medium: if people heed the call to protest despite the ban, even modest crowds could face rapid dispersal and localised clashes, particularly around key junctions and symbolic government locations."

Authorities repeat that any unauthorised march or rally will be treated as unlawful. While it is unclear how many residents will attempt to mobilise, previous incidents of deadly force during opposition demonstrations mean that even small gatherings carry a heightened risk of confrontation.\n\nBusinesses near known rally points are likely to close or operate with reduced hours, and public transport routes could be diverted or disrupted if police seal off sections of the city centre. For now the situation remains tense but calm; risk is medium, dominated by the potential for flash clashes if groups defy the protest ban."

  source:"https://www.reuters.com/world/greek-farmers-block-borders-airport-roads-protest-delayed-eu-farm-subsidies-2025-12-08/",
  summary:"Greek farmers have escalated a rolling campaign over delayed EU farm payments into a disruptive, multi-day national mobilisation. Tractor convoys and groups of livestock breeders have blocked key border crossings with Bulgaria and Turkey, staged rolling roadblocks on the Athens–Thessaloniki highway, and forced temporary closures at Heraklion and Chania airports on Crete.\n\nThe core grievance is the slow release of EU subsidies after a fraud scandal involving falsified land claims triggered tighter audits and delays, leaving a funding shortfall estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros. Farmers say they are facing a triple-hit: rising input costs, fallout from a severe sheep-pox outbreak that has wiped out thousands of animals, and the cash-flow crunch caused by withheld payments. Protest leaders argue that honest producers are being punished for the misconduct of a small group of fraudsters. \n\nTactically, the movement has shifted from symbolic rallies to pressure-point disruptions. On Crete, groups of demonstrators forced their way onto airport runways, briefly halting air traffic and, in some cases, damaging police vehicles and airport infrastructure. Elsewhere, tractors and hay bales have been used to choke off access roads to ports and toll plazas. These actions have generated confrontations with riot police, including exchanges of stones and tear gas. At least several officers have been reported injured in the clashes, and authorities have warned that criminal charges will follow for those identified on video.\n\nPolitically, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has publicly acknowledged the subsidy delays and promised that billions of euros in support will be disbursed, but has called for protesters to lift road and airport blockades and return to formal talks. Farmers’ committees are divided between hard-liners who favour sustained disruption and moderates who are cautious about alienating urban public opinion and the tourism sector. The risk level is assessed as high because of the combination of strategic infrastructure blockades, volatile confrontations around airports and border posts, and the potential for copy-cat road actions in other regions if no rapid compromise is reached."

  summary:"French unions have called a nationwide day of strikes and marches against the government’s 2026 budget plans, with demonstrations centred in Paris but echoed in cities across the country. Turnout is smaller than the huge pension protests earlier in the year, yet still large enough to disrupt public services, especially transport and education.\n\nThe CGT, FSU and Solidaires unions accuse the government of entrenching austerity through wage restraint and cuts to public services while households face persistent inflation. In Paris, union balloons and banners fill central avenues as teachers, civil servants, hospital workers and rail staff march to the National Assembly, demanding that lawmakers reject key budget articles. Protesters focus on wage purchasing power, hospital staffing and opposition to planned reductions in social spending. Rail and metro services are running on a reduced schedule, some schools are partially closed, and public-sector offices report higher levels of absenteeism as employees join the marches. Police presence is high but clashes are limited and largely confined to small groups on the fringes of the Paris rally. Overall risk is rated medium: the action is disruptive and involves multiple sectors but remains mostly peaceful and time-bounded to the single strike day."

Workers say they are overstretched and that the institution is prioritising prestige projects and expensive acquisitions over day-to-day security and maintenance.\n\nThe walkout follows a spectacular jewel heist earlier in the year, a major water leak that damaged heritage collections and the discovery of structural faults in a 1930s gallery. Strikers argue these episodes illustrate chronic under-investment in infrastructure and security. They also criticise a sharp ticket price rise for non-EU visitors, claiming the burden should not be shifted onto tourists while staff remain underpaid. The immediate operational impact will depend on participation, but visitors should be prepared for partial closures, slower entry screening and possible last-minute changes to gallery openings. The risk level is low: the action is limited to the museum, and while reputational and commercial impacts are significant, wider public-order issues are not expected."

The action runs from 9–12 December, with a flagship march on 9 December starting at the Hospital Clínico, moving past the Jiménez Fraud roundabout and along Bulevar Luis Pasteur before ending at the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nDoctors’ associations say that chronic understaffing, long waiting lists and pay scales that lag other Spanish regions are driving burnout and migration of specialists. Emergency and critical services will be maintained under minimum service rules, but outpatient appointments and non-urgent procedures are expected to be heavily disrupted. A further rally is scheduled outside the government’s Malaga delegation offices on 10 December. Authorities insist reforms and hiring are under way, yet talks have failed to avert December’s stoppage.

The rally, called by a coalition of civil-society organisations and diaspora groups, accuses Israel of violating the October truce through renewed airstrikes and tight restrictions on humanitarian aid flows.\n\nMarchers carry Palestinian flags and banners denouncing collective punishment and urging sanctions or arms embargoes. Speakers include local activists, academics and representatives of Muslim community organisations, who link events in Gaza to broader concerns about racism and surveillance at home. Swedish police supervise the route from Odenplan towards government buildings, using cordons to keep counter-protesters separate and minimise the risk of confrontation. So far the event has been noisy but peaceful, with limited disruption confined mainly to traffic diversions near the square and on the march route.

Members of the Unite union voted overwhelmingly for industrial action and have established picket lines at the factory entrance from the early hours of 8 December.\n\nThe dispute centres on management plans to lower wage scales for new hires and restructure shift patterns, which workers see as undermining long-term job security in a town where manufacturing opportunities are already limited. The strike halts most production at the hydraulics plant and may impact delivery schedules to downstream clients if quickly unresolved. Local solidarity from other unions is visible but modest. The situation is assessed as medium risk: it is economically disruptive at the plant level but geographically contained, with low likelihood of significant public-order issues beyond occasional tension at picket lines."

  summary:"Pro-Palestinian campaign networks mobilise activists to the European Parliament in Brussels on 12 December to demand Israel’s exclusion from the EU’s Horizon research programme. Demonstrators argue that continued scientific cooperation and funding flows amount to complicity in alleged war crimes and apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThe action combines a static rally with short marches around the Parliament complex. Participants display academic-themed slogans such as ‘No Research for Repression’ and call on universities and EU institutions to suspend partnerships with Israeli bodies linked to the defence and surveillance sectors. Organisers emphasise peaceful discipline but the thematic focus, location and timing – as MEPs debate budget lines – make the protest politically sensitive. Belgian police deploy barriers and crowd-control units around Parliament to prevent incursions into restricted zones. Risk is rated medium due to the potential for sit-ins, minor scuffles at police lines and spillover solidarity actions in nearby EU quarter offices."

    summary:"Activists in Mombasa are planning a solidarity march tied to Nairobi’s anti-tax/anti-cost-of-living mobilisation, focusing on port workers and informal traders. Further detail: demonstrations at the coast tend to be smaller but still disruptive because the port and freight corridors are strategic. Police there usually lean on rapid arrest of 'troublemakers' instead of heavy tear gas, so overt street battles are less common than in Nairobi. Medium risk: traffic slowdown around port access roads, pressure on small traders, possible brief arrests, but less likelihood of large-scale confrontation compared to the capital."

    summary:"COSATU-aligned unions are calling marches in Johannesburg over job cuts, wages falling behind inflation, and load-shedding pressure on workers. March routes typically run from a designated assembly point to provincial government offices, escorted by marshals and metro police. Further detail: prior COSATU 'Day of Action' demos in October generated rolling traffic closures in Durban CBD and parts of Johannesburg, but generally stayed controlled because COSATU stewards push a disciplined, union-branded march line. Medium risk: disruption to key intersections and administrative buildings is very likely; physical clashes are less likely unless unaffiliated groups break formation or police impose last-minute route changes."

Police in Madagascar have used batons and tear gas to break up crowds approaching administrative zones, but so far have mostly avoided mass arrests that could inflame anger further.

In prior demonstrations this month, police used tear gas and detained organisers to prevent marches from moving toward governorate offices.

    summary:"Community groups and trade union branches in Glasgow are adapting the UK-wide anti-austerity message that’s been building since the large London ‘no more cuts’ march this summer. Further detail: Glasgow organisers are targeting council-level funding decisions around social care and housing, accusing both local and central government of forcing ‘austerity 2.0.’ Scottish police typically allow static rallies in George Square but start issuing Section 14-style conditions if the crowd tries to ‘walk on’ toward key roads. Medium risk: not inherently violent, but can include loud confrontations with councillors and surprise sit-downs in the roadway."

    summary:"Marseille migrant aid groups and faith-based volunteers are planning a candlelight vigil at the Vieux-Port area to highlight deaths in the Mediterranean and conditions in offshore detention. Further detail: these vigils are usually calm, with speeches, photos of missing relatives, and press-friendly visuals (candles, banners). Police presence is normally low unless nationalist groups announce a counter-demo. Risk low: disruption is minimal and crowd tone is memorial/solidarity rather than confrontation, though organisers sometimes stream live testimonies from migrants, which can draw online harassment."

    summary:"Healthcare workers and patient advocacy groups are planning a daytime protest outside the Department of Health calling for emergency hiring, retention pay, and winter crisis funding. Further detail: this spins directly out of the anti-austerity framing used against the Labour government earlier this year, where demonstrators accused ministers of 'starving' public services to meet fiscal rules. NHS protests tend to be loud but controlled; unions act as marshals, and speakers include nurses, junior doctors, and patient families. Police risk is tagged medium because Westminster locations are sensitive and there’s a small chance of sit-ins or slow marches toward Downing Street."

  summary: "Blurb: Authorities banned a planned Oct-7 pro-Palestinian demo in Bologna; organisers indicated intent to proceed. Expect heavy policing, potential kettling, and a rapid escalation risk if the ban is defied.\n\nFurther info: On Oct 6, Italian officials prohibited a youth-organised Oct-7 march in Bologna, citing public-order concerns after recent unrest elsewhere. Organisers publicly disputed the ban and signalled they would still assemble, a pattern that often produces tense standoffs, route dispersals, and targeted arrests near the designated start area. Anticipate a large Carabinieri and Polizia di Stato footprint with riot units pre-positioned at likely corridors (historic center approaches, university district arteries) and hard perimeters guarding sensitive sites (railway station, municipal buildings). Tactics to expect include: cordons at choke points, selective stop-and-search, bans on pyrotechnics/face coverings, and rolling road closures to prevent an unpermitted procession. If the crowd attempts to move, police may split columns into side streets to dilute numbers; stun grenades and tear gas are typically reserved for serious disorder but remain possible should projectiles or barricades appear. Bystanders should avoid the immediate grid and leave extra time for transit around the old town ring; tram/bus diversions are likely in windows around assembly. Media crews should prepare for fast-moving dispersal orders and preserve press ID at hand. Risk is assessed as high due to (1) formal ban, (2) stated intent to continue, and (3) Italy’s elevated protest tempo in early October, including confrontations in Rome; all three factors increase volatility. Crowd size estimates will vary, but the operational picture suggests a substantial, closely managed gathering with a non-trivial chance of clashes if march attempts persist."

Organisers describe events as vigils, rallies and teach-ins; a multi-campus London march has been advertised, with other cities (Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow) running parallel assemblies. Expect afternoon peak crowds near central London squares and along typical student corridors; the Met will deploy liaison teams and impose conditions (start/finish points, amplified sound windows). Risk profile is medium: most events remain peaceful, but tensions can rise where counter-protests appear or where slogans edge into prohibited territory (leading to targeted arrests). Transit effects include bus diversions and intermittent holds at crossings; tube access around the main squares can be one-way during surges. Universities will operate stewarding and welfare tents; press should anticipate accreditation checks in campus spaces. The legal climate (including proposed expanded police powers for repeated protests) is an added context for cautious enforcement this month."

Anticipate Policia Nacional/municipal units using soft barriers to preserve traffic lanes, with potential penning near Congress if crowds attempt to approach sensitive zones.

Disruption should be localized—bus egress delays near depots, intermittent plaza saturation, and stop-and-search at access roads.

Historically, such flashpoints generate rapid follow-ups as supporters reconvene to demand releases and accountability. Anticipate concentrated evening assemblies on Rustaveli Avenue and adjacent squares, with armored police vehicles, riot lines, and staged arrest teams. Kettling is possible if marchers press controlled zones; journalists should be ready for line pushes and command-dispersal warnings.

The movement—loosely networked via social media under ‘GenZ 212’—frames demands around healthcare, education and accountability, with chants like “We don’t want the World Cup, health first.” Casablanca evening gatherings form at central squares and along retail corridors before surging into feeder streets. Police/gendarmerie establish layered cordons near government buildings and transportation hubs; plainclothes units may operate alongside riot police. Tactics observed in recent nights: fast kettling of youth clusters, baton charges to break mobile columns, and targeted arrests of perceived organisers. Property damage risk rises where crowd control pushes spill into narrow alleys or where improvised barricades are attempted. Bystanders should avoid protest corridors after dusk and anticipate hard closures around symbolic sites. Journalists should carry visible credentials and expect line pushes; wearing helmets/eye protection is prudent given the likelihood of thrown objects and crowd-control munitions if clashes escalate. The risk rating is high due to (1) sustained nightly cadence, (2) predominantly youthful, leader-lite mobilisation patterns that complicate de-escalation, and (3) a widening geography that stretches policing resources. Timings remain fluid—calls often circulate only hours ahead—so this 19:00 start reflects the current pattern rather than a fixed permit.

  summary: "Blurb: National organisers have called for a large Gaza ceasefire anniversary march on Oct 12 in Washington, D.C., converging on the National Mall and White House area. Expect very high turnout, extensive policing, and possible confrontations at fenced perimeters or counter-protest zones.\n\nFurther info: The mobilisation marks one year since the major ceasefire demonstrations of 2024 and is framed as a renewal of public pressure over Middle East policy. A coalition of activist networks, faith groups, and student blocs have announced bus convoys from over twenty states, suggesting attendance in the tens of thousands. The National Park Service has issued partial permits, and MPD along with U.S. Park Police will secure both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Ellipse, and Lafayette Square. Barricade grids will restrict lateral crossings; expect magnetometers and controlled entry at rally points near executive buildings. The U.S. Secret Service typically enforces exclusion zones within sight lines of the White House fence, and rapid-response lines will be pre-staged for crowd-control contingencies. Risk is rated high because of scale, historical volatility around this issue, and the near-certain presence of counter-demonstrators. In previous cycles, scuffles occurred when opposing groups intersected on 15th Street NW; law enforcement will likely create a hard buffer there. Metro stations around Smithsonian, Federal Triangle, and McPherson Square may close temporarily to manage flows. For participants and bystanders, carry hydration, identification, and expect long waits at security funnels. Journalists should maintain accreditation visible and anticipate movement restrictions near the fence lines. Dispersal normally begins before dusk but secondary marches sometimes form spontaneously along Constitution Ave, occasionally prompting short-term street closures into the evening."

The emergency decree empowers the military to support policing and restricts assembly in designated zones; however, organisers have vowed to continue non-violent resistance, denouncing repression. In Quito, assemblies typically form at El Arbolito/El Ejido and move toward the Centro Histórico or government precincts; police reinforce hard perimeters around Carondelet Palace and the Asamblea, deploy gas and water cannon at standoffs, and containerize select intersections. Outside the capital, expect intermittent roadblocks on Pan-American approach routes and provincial connectors (affecting freight and intercity buses). Risk is high due to (1) legal/emergency context, (2) history of intense clashes during subsidy disputes, and (3) multi-province geography stretching response capacity.

  summary: "Blurb: A very large Gaza solidarity march is slated to finish at the Sydney Opera House on Sun 12 Oct. Police have sought a court order to block the Opera House forecourt on safety grounds; organisers say the rally remains peaceful and will proceed. Expect major closures around Circular Quay and dense policing.\n\nFurther info: The Palestine Action Group (PAG) has noticed a high-profile demonstration to mark two years since the 2023 escalation. Anticipated turnout ranges from the low tens of thousands to well beyond that if regional buses arrive; even conservative scenarios exceed the safe capacity of the forecourt. NSW Police have moved in the Supreme Court to restrict the end-point, arguing egress, crushing risk, and limited spill-space. If the court upholds restrictions, expect last-minute route changes to adjacent large-capacity locations (Hyde Park, The Domain, or a finishing loop short of the sails). If the court declines to prohibit, police will impose hard cordons, penning to protect chokepoints (Macquarie Street, Opera House steps) and staged dispersal toward Circular Quay and the Royal Botanic Garden. Rolling closures will affect Cahill Expressway ramps, Macquarie St, and sections around the Overseas Passenger Terminal if crowd overflow reaches the foreshore. The policing posture will include riot units on standby, drone overwatch, Marine Area Command assets on the harbour, and liaison officers embedded with marshals. Risk factors: (1) venue symbolism (strong emotions and counter-protest magnet), (2) spatial constraints at the forecourt, (3) late operational changes if the court outcome lands close to step-off. Expected behaviour is rally-style with speeches, but friction can spike at barriers or where opposing groups attempt to intersect. Guidance: attendees should pre-agree meeting points outside the pen in case of communications issues; bystanders should avoid the Quay/Opera House precinct mid-afternoon through early evening; media should keep PPE and visible accreditation ready.

Protest calls often coincide with sudden gang roadblocks, firefights, and arson against public buildings. Demonstrations can begin peacefully (chants, flag lines, clergy-led prayers) but deteriorate quickly if armed groups exploit the crowd or security forces respond to gunfire nearby. Expect armored vehicles, tear gas, and live-fire risks in extreme scenarios. Travel within the capital is hazardous: key arteries (Delmas, Airport Rd, Nazon, Carrefour) may be cut without notice; the airport perimeter can be affected by nearby clashes; and fuel depots/ports are strategic targets. Journalists and civil society monitors should use ballistic PPE and maintain hardened transport with vetted drivers; route clearance is essential and may be impossible at short notice.

  summary: "Blurb: Civil society and youth groups are signalling a coordinated march on cost-of-living and governance issues. Expect heavy police deployment, rapid route changes, and a non-trivial risk of clashes near Waigani governmental precincts.\n\nFurther info: High-risk brief — PNG protests can shift quickly from peaceful assemblies to disorder when crowds meet police lines at ministerial or parliamentary approaches. Authorities typically pre-position mobile squads and establish roadblocks on Independence Dr and Sir John Guise Dr, with vehicle checks and intermittent closures. Protesters often attempt to approach Parliament House or key ministries; police respond with cordons, baton lines and targeted arrests if groups test the inner perimeter. The transport network is vulnerable: PMVs may suspend services on short notice; ad-hoc roadblocks can appear on key feeders (Boroko, Gordons) during dispersal, causing gridlock and isolating districts. Bystanders should avoid government corridors from late morning onward and carry contingency routes that do not depend on Waigani passages. Media crews should work in teams, keep credentials visible, and maintain standoff distances from shield lines; helmets/eye protection are prudent. Businesses along likely routes should secure frontage, move valuables away from glass, and consider early closure if turnout surges."

Protest calls can morph into quick-forming barricades at roundabouts and corridors near the port/airport axes. Gendarmerie deploys armored vehicles, drones, and tear gas when clearing routes; organisers counter with mobile spot gatherings to stretch police lines. If marches proceed peacefully, they typically follow fixed corridors with stewarding and speeches at civic spaces; however, splinter groups may break off at dusk, which historically correlates with vandalism spikes.
